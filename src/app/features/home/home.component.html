  <h1 class="section-title">About me.</h1>

  <p class="section-paragraph">
    - Imagine if Picasso had a laptop or Da Vinci dabbled in JavaScript â€“ that's me!
    An art lover with a fervent obsession in not just admiring tech, but also occasionally breaking and then fixing it.
  </p>

  <p class="section-paragraph">
    - As an art lover with a fervent interest in technology,
    I am constantly exploring the creative possibilities that arise from merging these two worlds.
    I am not one to shy away from challenging tech projects,
    and I am always eager to apply my natural curiosity to push beyond the boundaries of what is currently possible.
  </p>

  <p class="section-paragraph">
    - As someone who is detail-oriented yet able to keep sight of the bigger picture,
    I am able to balance the nitty-gritty technical aspects of a project with a broader,
    more creative perspective.
    This ability to maintain perspective and balance has served me well in both my professional and personal endeavors.
  </p>

  <p class="section-paragraph">
    - Overall, I am a tech-loving, art-appreciating, and detail-oriented individual
    who is passionate about taking on challenging projects and making a positive impact in the world of tech.
  </p>

  <p class="section-paragraph">
    - For a detailed tour of my technological escapades I've created (not that I've painted the Mona Lisa or anything), feel free to check my LinkedIn.
    Just hope the 'Artificial' in 'Artificial Intelligence' doesn't steal your job before you get there!
